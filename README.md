I found it very tedious to manually convert coordinates from DMS to UTM Easting/Northing and vice versa using GIS software, as well as calculating distances, which could take more than two days.  
To solve this, I created this Python tool to perform these tedious tasks instantly.  
Both the <strong>source files</strong> and <strong>output files</strong> are provided here for reference.
